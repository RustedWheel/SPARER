# SPARER Encryption Java implementation

This is the Java implementation for the prototype encryption system.

It allows for symmetric encryption and simulates the process to encrypt and decrypt the Patient Key using the Password Key.

This is only a proof-of-concept implementation and was not used for the actual blockchain system.

For full information on the project please look at https://github.com/j-x-huang/Medical-Blockchain.
